However, it gets tangled and complicated to organize CSS in a meaningful way for larger projects. Changing any line of CSS to style an element on one page often leads to unintended changes for elements on other pages. <br> <br> In order to deal with the inherent complexity of CSS, all sorts of different best practices have been established. The problem is that there isn’t any strong consensus on which best practices are in fact the best, and many of them seem to completely contradict each other.

(Much like the compliments I receive on the dance floor.) <br> <br>  In this follow-up post I’d like to put down the megaphone and put forward some practical advice. <br> <br> <b>The short version </b> <br> - There’s no need to try and avoid third-party code (huzzah!) <br> <br> - When collecting or displaying sensitive information, capture this information in a separate HTML file that contains no third-party JavaScript <br> <br>  - Display this file in an iframe <br> <br>  - Serve the file from a static file server on a different domain <br> <br>  You might also consider avoiding sensitive data entirely by using third-party sign-in and a third-party to collect and handle credit card information. <br> <br> The things I suggest in this post only really work for sites where sensitive information is quite limited and can be cordoned off (passwords, credit card numbers, etc). If you work on a chat app or an email client or a database GUI, where everything is potentially sensitive, I’ve got nuthin’.  <br> <br> <b>The eighteen-times-longer version </b> <br> <br> I think a healthy dose of fear is a good place to start. <br> <br>  I suggest pondering how you would feel making an announcement like OnePlus had to recently: <br> <br> … a malicious script was injected into the payment page code to sniff out credit card info while it was being entered… The malicious script operated intermittently, capturing and sending data directly from the user’s browser … up to 40k users at oneplus.net may be affected by the incident <br> <br> Oof. <br> <br> Now let’s sharpen that vague sense of dread into something more specific. <br> <br> Perhaps an animalogy will prove useful… <br> <br> I imagine <b>third-party code</b> as a big ol’ doberman. He looks calm; gentle, even. But there are flickers of an unknown potential in his dark, unblinking eyes. Let’s just say I’m not putting anything I hold dear near his pointy end. <br> <br> I picture my users’ <b>sensitive information </b> as a cute, defenceless hamster. I watch as it innocently licks its little front feet, grooming its dumb little face, frolicking without a care at the base of the doberman. <br> <br> Now, if you’ve ever been friends with a doberman (I highly recommend it), you probably know that they are wonderful, gentle creatures and don’t deserve their reputation for being vicious. But still, I’m sure you’ll agree it’s a bad idea to leave one alone with a hamster that bares a striking resemblance to a chew toy. <br> <br> Sure, maybe you’ll come home from work to the adorable scene of Professor Baggy Pants asleep on the back of Sergeant Chompers. Or maybe you’ll come home to witness only air where the hamster used to be, and a dog with his head cocked to one side, like “may I see the dessert menu?” <br> <br> I don’t think code that comes from npm, GTM or DFP or anywhere else should have a reputation for being necessarily dangerous. But I’d suggest that unless you can guarantee the good behaviour of this code, it’s irresponsible to leave it alone with your users’ sensitive information. <br> <br> So … that’s the mindset that I suggest we all adopt: sensitive information and <b>third-party code</b> should not be left alone together.', 'https://goo.gl/Sj2Ea1', 5);

Does this mean it is gradually giving up the ghost? There could be an ulterior motive! It could be generating digital coins for someone else. <br> <br> It is no secret that the popularity of digital currencies has reached dizzying heights in 2017. This in turn has coined a new meaning to the noun ‘hacker’; one considered more sophisticated, with profit in mind , who seeks to generate virtual coins without having to face the cost of computers or electricity, thus infiltrating your devices and networks instead. <br> <br> According to Security software technologies companies, this kind of malware features poignantly in the most recent ‘Global Threat Index’, with 10 different kinds of cryptocurrency mining tools making it in the top 100 malware. <br> <br>  <b>So how do these new hackers operate?</b> <br> <br>  In 2017, a few notorious file-sharing sites assisted their customers with code that reproduced digital currencies (mining) using their machines without their awareness or knowledge. The latest reports demonstrate that this trend is expected to be on the up and up and situation will take a turn for the worse, with the precise description standing as an impending “arms race”; a stiff competition between hackers and security companies. <br> <br>  Several services allow website owners or hackers with access, to set up a code on webpages popping up. This is what sets the cogs in motion. When attackers install malicious code into ads, they install cryptocurrency mining tools to garner coins. For some threat users, garnering coins might be easier and more profitable than using ransomware to take over an individual or system. <br> <br>  In December of 2017, a “sophisticated multi stage attack” seizing computer networks to mine cryptocurrencies, was reported. The hackers made use of loopholes in common server software coupled with networks leaks to infiltrate their targets’ systems and shift through their networks. The total of these 3 cryptojacking attacks? No less than $68,500 in the cryptocurrency Monero. <br> <br>  <b>What is Monero?</b> <br> <br> The 3-year old currency has become the weapon of choice for illegal mining operations. Designed with anonymity in mind, transactions identities and transaction amounts are purposely kept secret, thus making it hard to track the illegitimately-made gains across the register or blockchains that record transactions in the currency. While Monero has its legitimate purposes such as to buy music and merchandise from well-known recording artists, cryptocurrency fans wax lyrical on the weight it gives to privacy and its open approach to mining. However, mining malware linked to it has been spotted on a number of websites. <br> <br>  Monero was built on the basis of algorithms and allows people with ordinary computers to join the mining process, where users are paid to log transactions to the digital register. Other currencies, including Bitcoin require special hardware to be mined. <br> <br>  <b>How does it affect your laptop and your smartphone? </b><br> <br> For unaware computer users, an increased percentage in their Computer Power in the region of 80–100%, might be misconstrued as a sign of performance slowdown. On smartphones, unwanted mining can tax CPUs and exhaust the device, at times even causing physical damage. <br> <br>  Security firms have also reported detecting mobile malware that mines Monero, where threat actors upset users with a barrage of unwanted ads and also have the possibility to perpetrate a launch denial of service attacks. <br> <br>  <b>How to avoid leechlike mining from smartphones and web-based systems</b> <br> <br>  When it comes to your smartphone, make sure that you install apps only from trusted sources. Keep your software systems tightly patched and make to run anti-malware tools to clear the system of any shady code. <br> <br>  With regards web-based systems, it is suggested to adblock software that can help get rid of any JavaScript code that is accompanied by undesired cryptocurrency calculations. It is also recommended to have hardware or Software firewalls that can disrupt connections between mining tools and their command servers. Without this connection, the necessary data cannot be reached to reproduce hashes.<br> <br>  The Cyber security firm, CyberSift, is building futuristic anomaly detection systems, based on flagging connections and alarms that are triggered when hackers are at work. Such instances might happen when anomalies might highlight events that are not considered the norm. Thus, the aspect of defence in anomaly detection systems are shrouded, as a way to counter new emerging threats without relying on the usual rules. <br> <br>  It all depends, according to CyberSift, with providing the Security Analysts the right tools to focus on significant alarms, thereby reducing the mitigation time and efficiency. <br> <br>  As the cryptocurrency gold rush steamrolls ahead, there is no way of predicting the rise in number of cybercriminals joining the act.', 'https://goo.gl/Vwudan', 5);

An amazing looking or functioning website isn’t enough. Those are the two big things web design focuses on too.<br> <br> Form and function are only important as long as it helps a business meet its goals. That’s why I’m a big proponent of balancing the art and science of web design. <br> <br> The form (or art) of a website is about 10% of the purpose and the function (or science) of it is the other 90%. <br> <br> Of course, these numbers are absolutely not scientific but I put in terms of 10/90 to stress the importance of everything that goes into designing an effective website. Often times cheap web designers will charge you for web design only. They’ll whip up a nice looking website for you and charge you $500 to $1,500 but that doesn’t do you any good. It just costs you money.<br> <br> That’s where the website as a commodity idea comes in. It’s how most people think of a website. That’s unfortunate because a website can be so much more than a commodity.

That means your website shouldn’t just be there, it should be making you money.<br> <br>   Finding a good web designer involves one that is also well versed in marketing too. They don’t have to be a pro marketer but they must have a great working knowledge of it and how their job plays into that.<br> <br>   So now a deeper look into the real mix of a website between web design and marketing. <b>The 10% Web Design</b><br> <br>  I’m a web designer by trade since the very early days.

This particular class helps you to catch any throwable errors, irrespective of whether they are an exception or an error.<br><br>Error Class:<br>The error class in PHP 7 is a new type of class that handles the different error exceptions – either they are fatal errors or type errors.The main thing to remember before upgrading to PHP 7 is that if you have defined a custom error class having name error in the versions before PHP 7, then you have to be sure that you have changed your custom error class name. If you have not done that, then you will get the Fatal Error.', 'https://goo.gl/KAVuMS', 4);

In my eyes you’ve got a few options.<br><br>The Terminology Play<br><br>You mention that it’s prototypal inheritance, not prototypical and pretty much gloss over the rest, comfortable in your superiority in terminology. You may go as far as saying “Objects just come from other Objects because there aren’t any classes.” Then you just link to Crock’s Post on it, and try to seem busy for the next few days.<br><br>Many years later you find out that Prototypal and Prototypical are synonyms, but you choose to ignore this.<br><br>The Like-Classical-Inheritance-But-Different Play aka the Run-On Sentence Play<br><br>“So in Java, like, you have classes or whatever, right? Well so imagine that you don’t have those, but you still want to do that same type of thing or whatever, so then you just take another object instead of a class and you just kind of use it like it’s a class, but it’s not because it can change and it’s just a normal object, and if it changes and you don’t override the object, oh yea, so you can decide to override the parent object class thing, so if you dont do that and the parent changes the link is live…”<br><br>And so forth.', 'https://goo.gl/LFp7bU', 3);

This would allow the arbitrary code inside the malicious attachment to execute in the context of the victim''s session.<br><br>If the victim is logged on with administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of the affected system, eventually allowing them to install programs, create new accounts with full user rights, or view, change or delete data.<br><br>"What’s truly frightening with this bug is that the Preview Pane is an attack vector, which means simply viewing an email in the Preview Pane could allow code execution," explained the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).<br><br>"The end user targeted by such an attack doesn’t need to open or click on anything in the email – just view it in the Preview Pane. If this bug turns into active exploits – and with this attack vector, exploit writers will certainly try – unpatched systems will definitely suffer."<br><br>The second Outlook vulnerability (CVE-2018-0850), rated as important, is a privilege escalation flaw that can be leveraged to force the affected version of Outlook to load a message store over SMB from a local or remote server.<br><br>Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted email to an Outlook user, and since the bug can be exploited when the message is merely received (before it is even opened), the attack could take place without any user interaction.<br><br>"Outlook would then attempt to open a pre-configured message store contained in the email upon receipt of the email," Microsoft explains in its advisory. "This update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring Office fully validates incoming email formatting before processing message content."<br><br>Both the Outlook vulnerabilities have been discovered and reported to the tech giant by Microsoft''s researcher Nicolas Joly and former Pwn2Own winner.<br><br>Critical Microsoft Edge Vulnerability<br><br>Another critical flaw, which is an information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2018-0763), resides in Microsoft Edge that exists due to Microsoft Edge''s improperly handling of objects in the memory.<br><br>An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to successfully obtain sensitive information to compromise the victim''s machine further.<br><br>"To exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website in an attempt to exploit the vulnerability. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability," Microsoft explains.<br><br>"However, in all cases an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a link that takes the user to the attacker''s site."<br><br>Other critical issues include several Scripting Engine Memory Corruption vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge that could be exploited to achieve remote code execution in the context of the current user.<br><br>Microsoft Edge flaw (CVE-2018-0839), rated as important, is an information disclosure vulnerability that exists due to Microsoft Edge improper handling of objects in the memory.<br><br>Successful exploitation of the bug could allow attackers to obtain sensitive information to compromise the user''s system further.<br><br>Internet Explorer also got a patch to address an information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2018-0847), rated important, that would let a webpage use VBScript to fetch stored information from memory.<br><br>Publicly Disclosed Vulnerability Before Being Patched<br><br>Although the list of patched vulnerabilities does not include any zero-day flaws, one of the security flaws (CVE-2018-0771) in Microsoft Edge was publicly known before the company released patches, but was not listed as being under active attack.<br><br>Listed as Moderate, the issue is a Same-Origin Policy (SOP) bypass vulnerability which occurs due to Microsoft Edge''s improper handling of requests of different origins.<br><br>The vulnerability could allow an attacker to craft a webpage to bypass the SOP restrictions and get the browser to send data from other sites--requests that should otherwise be ignored due to the SOP restrictions on place.<br><br>Meanwhile, Adobe on Tuesday also released security updates for its Acrobat, Reader and Experience Manager products to address a total of 41 security vulnerabilities, out of which 17 are rated as critical and 24 important in severity.<br><br>Users are strongly advised to apply security patches as soon as possible to keep hackers and cybercriminals away from taking control of their computers.<br><br>For installing security updates, simply head on to Settings → Update & security → Windows Update → Check for updates, or you can install the updates manually.', 'https://goo.gl/eY7wdW', 5);
